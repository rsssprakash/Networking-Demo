 ## Networking-Demo

“Networking is the process of connecting two or more devices so they can share data and resources. 
This can happen with or without the internet. For example, in an office LAN, computers can share files or printers without using the internet.”
 
  “Networking can be divided into three main types:

LAN (Local Area Network): small area like home, office.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): covers a city or large campus.

WAN (Wide Area Network): covers countries and continents. The Internet is the best example.”

Use real-life examples – It makes your teaching more clear.

LAN = Office Wi-Fi or home router

MAN = A city’s government offices network

WAN = The Internet / banking networks across countries

##DHCP 
DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices in a network, 
so they can communicate without manual configuration.”

✅ Example:
“When I connect my phone to office Wi-Fi, the DHCP server (usually the router) automatically gives my phone an IP address.
Without DHCP, I would have to set the IP manually.
