 ## Networking-Demo

“Networking is the process of connecting two or more devices so they can share data and resources. 
This can happen with or without the internet. For example, in an office LAN, computers can share files or printers without using the internet.”
 
  “Networking can be divided into three main types:

LAN (Local Area Network): small area like home, office.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): covers a city or large campus.

WAN (Wide Area Network): covers countries and continents. The Internet is the best example.”

Use real-life examples – It makes your teaching more clear.

LAN = Office Wi-Fi or home router

MAN = A city’s government offices network

WAN = The Internet / banking networks across countries
